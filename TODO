Game idea:
    Rogue-like zombie shooter

    Game features:
        - random map generation like in JS13K 2017 Lost
        - different weapons:
            - pistol
            - shotgun
            - rifle
            - knife
            - axe            
        - permadeath
        - if bit by a zombie you have 30s to find a antidote                    
        - you cannot carry more than one weapon at the same time
        - you can only pick up ammo for the weapon you are holding        
        - you can hurt and slow down zombies by throwing anything

    Goals per level:
        - finding a key to open a specific door or hatch
        - something with stairs
        - finding a weapon
        - finding ammo

Must have:
    ☐ Archways need to be closed with a door or replaces with an empty wall when there's nothing behing it
    ☐ validate that you don't start in a room without doors

    
Would like:    
    ☐ Muzzle Particles
    ☐ Blood particles
    ☐ sound fx when hitting the zombie
    ☐ Zombie should not die of 1 bullet ('health')
    ☐ Title screen

Should have:
    ☐ progressively get harder
    ☐ game over screen

Could have:
    ☐ miss particles
    ☐ limited bullets
    ☐ if out of bullets, you should be able to hit the zombie with fists (hand tracking)
