Game idea:
    Rogue-like zombie shooter

    Game features:
        - random map generation like in JS13K 2017 Lost
        - different weapons:
            - pistol
            - shotgun
            - rifle
            - knife
            - axe            
        - permadeath
        - if bit by a zombie you have 30s to find a antidote                    
        - you cannot carry more than one weapon at the same time
        - you can only pick up ammo for the weapon you are holding        
        - you can hurt and slow down zombies by throwing anything

    Goals per level:
        - finding a key to open a specific door or hatch
        - something with stairs
        - finding a weapon
        - finding ammo

Must have:
    ☐ Archways need to be closed with a door or replaces with an empty wall when there's nothing behing it
    ☐ validate that you don't start in a room without doors
    ☐ validate that that there are at least a couple of rooms
    ☐ Some Props cannot be placed in front of an arch, or a window. How can we prevent that while keeping the randomization
Would like:    
    ☐ Muzzle Particles
    ☐ Blood particles
    ☐ sound fx when hitting the zombie
    ☐ Zombie should not die of 1 bullet ('health')
    ☐ Title screen

Should have:
    ☐ progressively get harder
    ☐ game over screen

Could have:
    ☐ miss particles
    ☐ limited bullets
    ☐ if out of bullets, you should be able to hit the zombie with fists (hand tracking)

Thoughts and ideas:
    - We could link rooms together. Every room will get a list of rooms that are connected to it.
        - we need to keep track of what exit links to what room
        - We could use this to help the zombies navigate, because we can do a search on rooms first and use something like A* for the last pieces.
    - I would love to figure out a way to create paths that circle. Rooms with 2 exits connecting a 1 other room with 2 exits.
    - A room should have a type, like living room, kitchen, bathroom or bedroom. The furniture should be random, but based on the type of room.
    - Also connecting rooms should be kinda logical. It doesn't make sense to have a bedroom with 2 kitchens connected to it.
    - When we start working on other types of levels, like the basement, we could also define a couple of rooms with a specific type.
    - models to draw:
        - kitchen:
            - stove
            - table
            - chair
            - cupboard
            - fridge
            - sink
        - bedroom:
            - bed
            - dresser
            - nightstand
        - living room:
            - couch
            - tv
            - sofa
            - lamp
            - bookshelf
        - bathroom:
            - bathtub
            - shower
            - sink
            - toilet
        - office
            - desk
            - chair
            - cabinet
            - bookshelf
